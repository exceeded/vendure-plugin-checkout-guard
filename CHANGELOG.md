## [0.1.4] — 2026-09-28

Follow-up to the 0.1.3 audit. No schema changes; nothing to migrate.

### Changed
- **Client-IP trust model.** `trustedClientIp.trustedProxies` (IPv4/IPv6
  addresses or CIDRs) names the proxies in front of the API.
  `x-forwarded-for` is now only consulted when the TCP peer is one of them,
  and the client address is the right-most entry that is not itself a
  trusted proxy — a browser can no longer inject an address into the rate
  limiter, funnel or decline log. Without `trustedProxies` the header is
  ignored and `req.ip` (your `apiOptions.trustProxy` setting) or the socket
  is used. `trustCloudflareHeader` now defaults to `false` unless
  `trustedProxies` is set or it is enabled explicitly; with `trustedProxies`
  it is only read from a trusted peer. The secret-header path
  (`x-real-client-ip` + `x-checkout-guard-proxy`) is unchanged and still
  wins. Invalid `trustedProxies` entries fail at boot. The effective values
  are shown in the Settings tab. **Hosts that relied on the first
  `x-forwarded-for` entry without `trustProxy` should set `trustedProxies`.**
- **Auto-capture off the row lock.** A below-threshold hold is now captured
  after the recording transaction commits (same result, same alerts); the
  Stripe capture call no longer runs while `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` is held on
  the order row. If the capture fails the hold stays Authorized and a
  `hold.capture_failed` alert is raised instead of rolling the hold back.
- **Live intent check before recording a hold.** Before
  `amount_capturable_updated` adds a payment, the PaymentIntent is retrieved
  from Stripe (outside the transaction). `requires_capture` proceeds as
  before; `succeeded` is recorded and settled immediately (captured in the
  dashboard before the event was delivered); `canceled` is logged as a
  `hold_expired` payment event with a `hold.expired` alert and no payment is
  added; any other status is ignored. A redelivered event is de-duplicated
  before the Stripe call. When the channel has no Stripe key or Stripe is
  unreachable the signed event payload is used as before.
- **Admin UI.** Effective settings are cached after the first load (only
  Refresh re-fetches them) and every HTTP/modal subscription is torn down
  when the page is left.

### Added
- Unit tests for `StripeHoldService` (webhook flow, dedupe, channel/order
  errors, transition failure, premium lock, capture/cancel state mapping,
  safety capture), `BankTransferService` (channel-scoped listing, mark
  received / cancel incl. stale-under-lock, sweep expire + remind, stranded
  repair) and `ReconciliationService.runOnce` (orphan rows, second-run
  dedupe, single alert, persisted last run) on lightweight fakes — no
  database.
- Postgres corpus test (`src/__tests__/pg-corpus.test.ts`, runs when
  `HULO_PG_URL` is set): extracts every SQL template literal, translates it
  through the dialect adapter and executes it against PostgreSQL 17 with
  quoted-camelCase stand-ins for the Vendure tables. 37/37 statements pass.
- `parseCidr`, `isTrustedProxy`, `clientIpFromForwardedFor`, `ipToBigInt`
  are exported for hosts that want the same matcher.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-09-28

Reliability and performance pass — no new features. One small table
(`checkout_guard_state`) and two best-effort indexes on `payment` are
created on boot; nothing to migrate.

### Fixed
- **Bank transfer settle/cancel race.** "Mark as received" (server) and the
  expiry sweep (worker) now settle or cancel under a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
  with the payment state re-read inside the transaction, so a paid order can
  no longer be cancelled by an overlapping sweep. The sweep also takes a
  cross-process lock, records `expiredAt` before it cancels, and the
  stranded-order repair only touches orders the sweep itself expired.
- **Stripe hold capture/cancel race.** The hourly safety capture, a
  `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook and an admin click can overlap: capture
  and release now lock the payment row and re-check its state; a hold that
  is already Settled/Cancelled reports success to non-admin callers instead
  of raising a `capture_failed` alert.
- **Postgres.** Every raw query that touches a Vendure table quotes its
  camelCase columns (`transactionId`, `createdAt`, `orderId`, `channelId`,
  `currencyCode`, `emailAddress`, `customerId`), which Postgres otherwise
  folds to lowercase. Bank-transfer listing and sweep, orphan and hold KPIs,
  `findOrderByCode` and reconciliation's known-intent set were silently
  empty on Postgres hosts before.
- **Ops alerts never hold a Stripe webhook.** Alerts from the hold path are
  fire-and-forget; one pooled SMTP transport with 5 s connect / 10 s socket
  timeouts and a 12 s send cap replaces a fresh transport per e-mail;
  `hold.webhook_error` is delivered even when premium is locked and is also
  logged at error level; chat webhooks now treat non-2xx as a failure.
- **Rate limiter.** GraphQL comments are stripped before the mutation
  matcher runs (`applyCouponCode # x\n(` was invisible to it); IPv6 clients
  are bucketed per /64.
- **Channel scoping.** Admins working in a non-default channel only see and
  act on that channel's bank transfers, payment events, KPIs and funnel.
- **Amount drift** is evaluated only once the order has left the payment
  phase, so multi-payment checkouts are not reported as underpaid.
- **Permissions.** Self-update, licence activate and deactivate require
  SuperAdmin (they were reachable with `UpdateOrder`). `paymentId` route
  params are validated. Purchase-link failures no longer echo upstream
  error text; the evaluation reminder validates the e-mail and times out
  after 8 s. `webhookSecretConfigured` also honours the
  `STRIPE_CG_WEBHOOK_SECRET*` environment variables.
- Tracking rows are inserted with `INSERT IGNORE` (no duplicate-key 500
  after a concurrent settle).

### Changed
- **Funnel summary is aggregated in SQL** (`GROUP BY step` with
  `COUNT(DISTINCT …)`) instead of loading every beacon in the window into
  Node; `summariseFunnelCounts` exposes the same pure summary from counts.
- **Retention cron** (worker, 03:20): funnel beacons 90 days, `failed` and
  `client_declined` events 180 days, all other payment events 400 days.
  Both tables grew without bound before.
- **Reconciliation** takes a cross-process lock (admin "Run now" vs the
  04:10 worker run), persists its last result in `checkout_guard_state` so
  the dashboard shows it whichever process ran it, reads known intents in
  one query and de-duplicates orphans in batches of 500 instead of one
  `SELECT` per intent.
- Best-effort indexes `idx_cg_payment_txn (transactionId)` and
  `idx_cg_payment_state_method (state, method)` on Vendure's `payment`
  table (skipped silently where the host cannot create them).
- Payment-method lookups are cached for 30 s (bank-transfer codes, Stripe
  keys) and handler-code `LIKE` patterns are escaped rather than stripped.
- Admin UI: OnPush change detection, `trackBy` on every table, cached
  currency formatters, and the overview fetches 8 recent events instead of
  200.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-18

### Changed
- **Vendure plugin directory readiness.** The plugin class, every service and the bank-transfer events carry `@category` JSDoc tags (Plugin / Services / Events); the runtime `compatibility` declaration now matches the tested range `>=3.5.0 <4.0.0` instead of `^3.0.0`.
- **README:** npm, download, Vendure and database badges, a four-step *Quick start* at the top (including the admin-UI compile step) and a *Compatibility* section. No functional changes.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Admin capture / release of a hold on a non-default channel** used the admin request's channel, where the channel's `stripe-hold` method does not exist (`error.payment-method-not-found`). Both now act in the order's own channel, like the cron and webhook paths.
- **Webhook responses:** an unexpected error while recording a hold, or a locked premium tier, now answers 5xx so Stripe retries the delivery instead of the hold being lost; an ops alert (at most hourly) explains the locked case.
- **Duplicate webhook deliveries** for one PaymentIntent are serialised (in-process mutex plus a row lock on the order), so two Authorized payments can no longer be attached to one intent.
- Ops fan-out (Slack / webhooks / SMTP) no longer runs inside the webhook's database transaction.
- Capture / cancel idempotency keys carry a minute bucket, so a failed capture is not replayed as the same error for 24 hours.
- Safety capture releases (never charges) a hold whose order was cancelled.
- Bank-transfer sweep finishes cancelling orders that a failed `cancelOrder` left in PaymentAuthorized with a cancelled payment (`repaired` in the sweep result).
- Admin UI: the Bank transfers, Holds and Funnel tabs read the fields the server actually sends.
- Overview KPIs count holds and transfers by the handler behind each channel's payment method, not by a guessed method code.
- Shop API rate limiter: multipart (file-upload) GraphQL requests are limited too.
- `trustedClientIp.trustCloudflareHeader` (default true) lets deployments reachable without Cloudflare ignore `cf-connecting-ip`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Stripe holds.** A `stripe-hold` payment handler and a signed webhook (`POST /checkout-guard/stripe-webhook`) for `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated`, so a manual-capture PaymentIntent becomes an *Authorized* Vendure payment and the order is placed (`PaymentAuthorized`). Capture and cancel from the admin (`/checkout-guard/holds`), a safety capture before Stripe's seven-day authorisation window closes, `payment_intent.payment_failed` recorded as a payment event. Per-channel webhook secrets via `STRIPE_CG_WEBHOOK_SECRET_<CHANNELCODE>`.
- **Bank transfer.** A `bank-transfer` payment handler whose account details travel in the payment's public metadata (storefronts render them, nothing hard-coded), an eligibility checker (min / max amount, guests, customer groups), auto-expiry of unpaid orders after N days with a reminder event before that, and admin *received* / *cancel* actions.
- **Guards.** `SessionBoundOrderByCodeAccessStrategy` (anonymous `orderByCode` only from the session that placed the order, via the `cgSessionHash` Order custom field), a trusted client-IP middleware (`x-real-client-ip` honoured only with the `x-checkout-guard-proxy` secret header) with `getClientIp()`, and token-bucket rate limits on Shop API mutations (`applyCouponCode`, `addPaymentToOrder`, `createStripePaymentIntent`, `transitionOrderToState`).
- **Observability.** A payment-event log (webhook failures, storefront-reported declines, orphaned charges, amount drift, expired holds and transfers), `POST /checkout-guard/client-decline`, nightly Stripe ↔ Vendure reconciliation per channel, an amount-drift guard on settlement, checkout funnel events (`POST /checkout-guard/funnel`) with a per-step summary, and ops alerts to Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, a signed webhook and email.
- **Admin dashboard** at *Sales → Checkout Guard*: Overview, Holds, Bank transfers, Payment events, Funnel, Settings, plus the Licence & billing card (14-day card-backed trial, buy from the admin, Stripe billing portal).
- Free tier: session-bound order lookup, trusted client IP, rate limits, funnel events, the bank-transfer handler and checker, dashboard. Premium: Stripe holds, bank-transfer expiry and reminders, failed-payment recording, reconciliation, drift guard, ops alerts.
